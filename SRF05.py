# A very simple Python interface to SFR05 module (probably will work with SFR04 too but I have no tried).
# Just call measure() method and it will return you distance in centimeters or None.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: in order to read data from the sensore we need to measure width of an echo pulse
# and we need to be accurate enough. This obviously is not going to work well if your CPU is heavily loaded.
# Plus, Python with its GIL is just not the best environment for these things if you have other threads running.
# But make no mistake - doing that in C is not a silver bullet either even if done properly with interrupts etc.
# Sure, C version would have better accuracy but if you really want to avoid interference with other threads/processes,
# you should use a sensor that times echo iself and then gives you result via digital interface (like I2C or SPI).
